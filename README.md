Hello. Nice to see you here. :)

# Overview
I am Ioana Negurici and I recently ended an Internship / QA Engineer Course at GoIT. During the last 4 months I was involved in various projects
within GoIT, regarding manual testing. As a student within GoIT I designed and created lots of test cases based on various requirements, performed manual testing
on various apps and websites, and the highlight of the Internship was being the Scrum Master of the final project, the testing of a money management app.
