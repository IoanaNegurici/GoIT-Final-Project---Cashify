Hello. Nice to see you here. :)

# Overview
I am Ioana Negurici and I recently ended an **Internship / QA Engineer Course** at GoIT. During the last 4 months I was involved in various projects
within GoIT, regarding manual testing. As a student within GoIT I designed and created lots of test cases based on various requirements, and also bug reports, performed manual testing on various apps and websites, and the highlight of the Internship was being the **Scrum Master** of the final project, the testing of a money management app called **Cashify**.

**GoIT Final Project Retrospective**
<br>During the final project I was responsible for the following:
<br> • **Facilitator:** I succesfully managed the exchange of information between our team of 7, overviewed their progress and made sure that we stick to the deadline.
<br> • **Assigning Tasks:** I created smoke checklists to ensure that all requirements are met, shared the tasks with my team and made a traceability matrix for an easier way to follow testing execution.
<br> • **Testing:** Designing and creating test cases, executing them and writing bug reports where needed.
<br> • **Quality Assurance:** I ensured about the quality of our work before submission or delivery. Also gave consistent feedbacks to the team and helped them when needed.
<br>
<br> The final project was about testing a money management app, compatible for both Web and Mobile devices. With **Cashify** you can successfully track income, expenses and generate detailed reports based on them.

<br> **Being a student at GoIT was a really valuable learning opportunity for me, and I am sure that my journey as a QA Engineer will be at least as challenging as this was.**
<br> **Thank you for the interest showed and feel free to contact me when needed.:)**
